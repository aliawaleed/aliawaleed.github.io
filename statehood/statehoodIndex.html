        <h2>What makes Zomia different and difficult to be ruled?</h2>
        <center><img src="hills.jpg" alt="image" style="width:70%;"></center>
        <div class="text">
          <p>"Zomia is an alternate world, a realm of mutable, outlaw cultures, creating almost no empires and resisting being incorporated into those that originated elsewhere." It consists of a number of groups (or tribes) that are organized in ways that are different from one another, such as the Lahu, Khmu, Akha, Karen,Kachin, Chin, Hmong, Yao/Mien, Wa, and the list goes on. The organizational structure in the first three, for example, is strongly egalitarian and decentralized, whereas the rest areboth relatively hierarchical subgroups and relatively decentralized, egalitarian subgroups.</p>
          <p>Other factors that make Zomia different or difficult to rule include: </p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Cultural Refusal and Political Resistance</b></li>
            <li><b>Diversity:</b> cultural variation</li>
            <li><b>Agricultural lifestyle:</b> swiddening vs. fixed agriculture</li>
            <li><b>Social Structure:</b> flexible and egalitarian vs. hierarchical</li>
            <li>The <b>sociological pyramid</b> is flat and local</li>
            <li><b>Hierarchy and centralization</b> is not constant</li>
            <li>Relatively <b>stateless</b></li>
            <li><b>Geographical isolation</b> from centers of states of power</li>
            <li>The population has <b>actively resisted:</b></li>
              <ul>
                <li>The classical state</li>
                <li>The colonial state</li>
                <li>The independent nation-state</li>
              </ul>
          </ul>
          <p>Taking a closer look at Wa, that live along the Myanmar-China border, they have their own "unofficial narcostate" that they fund by producing poppy or smuggling heroin, and they are protected by a 20,000-strong army.</p>

        <h2>How does Scott's understanding/idea of Zomia differ from other scholars?</h2>
        <div class="text">
          <p> Scott shows that Zomia "offers a sort of counter-history of the evolution of human civilization". He believes that all what they are doing is not forgotten by civilization, but rather intentional and deliberate. He argues that <b>civilized life has been a burden and a menace</b>, according to Bennett. His interpretation of their behavior is based on the way that he depicts their alternative past, where people living there either escaped the state or were driven out by it.</p>
          <p> Throughout his book, Scott tries to show that the economic, political, and cultural organization of Zomia is done strategically in a way that they would be able to escape state structures. He believes that the whole point of the people not having anything permanent; moving around, shifting between languages and religions, having ephermal leadership, and so on, is to make it impossible for state leaders to install effective sovereignty over the people. Moreover, he states that they do not even document or write their history and intentionally choose to remain illiterate to ensure that hierarchies don't arise.</p>
          <p> While some scholars, and people in general, agree with Scott, others have different opinions regarding the topic. They often perceive Scott's opinion as an overgeneralization about the region and that he considers their traditions and decisions intentional, or with political motives. He disregards the fact that this may just be the case due to ecological reasons, or just merely due to coincidences. They also often perceive the people as "primitive" because they are not fixed and they do not adopt modern practices.</p>
          <p> There are also controversial opinions about the relationship between the people in the hills and the lowland states where Scott's view is based on appropriation and is anarchist-tinged, while anthropologists perceive it as a more complex combination of suspicion and reliance, where the lowland states are not just oppressors but rather a source of goods, services, and even protection.</p>
          <p> Michaud, a specialist on the Hmong people, criticizes Scott by focusing on his generalizations, as for example, the Shan, in Burma, the Tay and Nung, in Vietnam, and the Zhuang, in China’s Guangxi Province, all have hierarchal or feudal societies, and he believes that in that way they have effectively formed their own states.</p>

        <h2>About Zomia</h2>
        <img src="moreland.png" alt="image" style="width:100%;">
          <p>One of the largest nonstate spaces in the world. <b>Nonstate space:</b> an area of land where the state has trouble establishing or maintaining authority over the territory or its people.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>"Zomia"</b></li>
              <ul>
                <li>Zo: "remote"; living in hills</li>
                <li>Mi:  "people"</li>

            <li><b>Size:</b> 2.5 million km2</li>
            <li><b>Population:</b> 100 million+ </li>
            <li><b>Ethnicity:</b> hundreds</li>

          </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Is Zomia a "region"?</h3>
        <p>A region is defined as an area of land that is considered a unit with definable characteristics and similarities.</p>
        <p>According to Scott, water generally joins people, whereas hills tend to divide people.</p>
        <p>Zomia is therefore a "negative" region, as it has more variety than uniformity.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>There is <b>cultural variation</b> in all aspects, such as:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Language</li>
            <li>Dress</li>
            <li>Settlement patterns</li>
            <li>Ethnicities</li>
            <li>Religious patterns</li>
            <li>Economic activity</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Connection between the people</h3>
        <p> While the different groups (or tribes) may not be directly connected, there seems to be a common trend in elevation where people in the same altitudes, even if they are thousands of kilometers away, have similar cultures, rather than political unity.</p>
        <ul>
          <li> Coherent identities are maintained due to:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Long-distance travel</li>
            <li>Marriage alliances</li>
            <li> Subsistence patterns</li>
            <li>Cultural continuity</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li> Some hill groups are in a tributary relationship w/valley kingdoms to:</li>
          <ul>
            <li> Control lucrative trade routes </li>
            <li> Safeguard privileged access to valuable markets</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
          <ul>
            <li> Hill societies also contributed to the economy of lowland societies through:</li>
            <ul>
              <li> Providing them with forest products</li>
              <li> Sent valuable and taxable products such us elephant tusks, medicinal herbs, livestock, animal organs, feathers, and more</li>
            </ul>

      <h3> What do the peoples of Zomia have in common?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li> The sense of being different from each other and the majority</li>
          <li> Geographical remoteness </li>
          <li> State of marginality</li>
          <li> Cultural, political, and economic distance from Asia’s centers</li>
          <li> Besides the Karen and the Chin, the rest of the societies do not fulfill the structural criteria needed for strong nationalist movements, according to Anthony Smith. <b>The criteria are: </b></li>
                <ul>
                  <li> Infrastructure (identified territory, a political authority, and an administration)</li>
                  <li> Cultural core (language, myths, and traditions)</li>
                  <li> Movement bearers (urban middle class)</li>

        <h3>The Art of Not Being Governed</h3>
        <img src="book.jpg" alt="image" style="width:100%;">
        <p> A lot of the information obtained is based on James C. Scott's book <I>The Art of Not Being Governed: An Anarchist History of Upland Southeast Asia.</I> </p>
        <p> This book provides an anthropological and historical study of the land of Zomia in Southeast Asia, and it brought a lot of attention to the place and controversy about the civilization.</p>
        <p> Scott's main argument revolves around how the people in the highlands/hills are "barbaric by design".</p>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Discussion Questions</h3>
        <div class="fakeimg"> Knowing that there were many failed attempts in exercising authority over Zomia, how can other neocolonialism practices come into place?</div><br>
        <div class="fakeimg"> Seeing that their community is not chaotic, do people have to be governed? How sustainable is their way of living?</div><br>
        <div class="fakeimg"> What are the drawbacks of living in a stateless society? How would they apply to the people living in Zomia? </div>
