          This movie is made by 3 students that are studying at New York University Abu Dhabi.
          The whole movie was done in a combined total time of 30 minutes, with the filming and editing, all was done remotely.
          The idea presented is that of a morning routine of all three students where each student films a different part.
          This starts from waking up and turning the alarm off, some steps in between, all the way to turning on the laptop and joining a zoom class.
